# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built in Python featuring two modes:
- **Human vs AI**: Play against a computer opponent.
- **AI vs AI**: Watch two AI agents play against each other using the minimax algorithm.

The game includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for an interactive experience.

## Features

- **Human vs AI Mode**: Play the classic game against an AI opponent.
- **AI vs AI Mode**: Observe an AI vs AI match with the minimax algorithm determining the moves.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: AI uses the minimax algorithm to choose optimal moves.
- **GUI**: Provides a user-friendly interface for playing and watching the game.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Programming language used to build the game logic.
- **Tkinter**: Python library used for creating the graphical user interface.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Algorithm used by the AI to determine the best move.
